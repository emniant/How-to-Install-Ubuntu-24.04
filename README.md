As it appears in the image, we download our iso file from the specified link

2. Create a Bootable USB stick

To set up Ubuntu Desktop, you'll need to create an installation medium by writing the ISO file you downloaded onto a USB drive. 
This isn't the same as simply copying the ISO; it requires special software to complete the process.

For this tutorial, we will use rufus. Select the version corresponding to your current operating system, download and install the tool.

Select your downloaded ISO, choose your USB flash drive, and then click Flash! to install your image.

3. Boot from USB flash drive

Plug the USB flash drive into the laptop or PC where you plan to install Ubuntu, then boot up or restart the device. 
It should detect the installation media right away. If it doesn’t, hold down F12 during startup and choose the USB drive from the boot options menu specific to your system.

NOTE:
F12 is typically the key to access your system’s boot menu, though Escape, F2, or F10 are also frequently used. 
If you're uncertain, keep an eye out for a quick message during startup—this usually indicates which key to press to open the boot menu.

a) After the installer is started, you can select your language

c) Connect to your network. This will allow Ubuntu to install updates and drivers during installation

5. Installation Setup

You'll be asked to select either Interactive or Automated Installation. 
Interactive is the typical setup process, but for advanced users, the automated option allows importing a configuration file from a web server, 
making it easy to standardize multiple installations and apply additional customizations.

![f735c2969c6a39079e02bcf7245ad42a928dd7f7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c3b1abe-8c43-4b3e-a469-7ad0d5609d05)

In this guide, we’ll go with the main option. You’ll be prompted to select between Default and Extended installations. 
The Default setup includes essential components to get you started, with more available through the App Center post-installation. 
The Extended option, on the other hand, comes with extra office tools and utilities that are useful if you need offline functionality.

On the next screen, you’ll see an option to install third-party software to enhance device compatibility and performance 
(such as Nvidia graphics drivers) and to enable support for extra media formats. It’s recommended to select both options.

6. Type of installation

This screen lets you set up your installation preferences. To make Ubuntu the sole operating system on your hard drive, choose "Erase disk and install Ubuntu."
If your device already has another operating system, you’ll see additional options allowing you to install Ubuntu alongside it, rather than overwriting it.

7. Create Your Login Details

On this screen, you'll need to provide your name and the name of your computer as it will be displayed on the network. You will also create a username and a strong password.
You can decide whether to log in automatically or to require a password. If you plan to use your device while traveling, it’s advisable to keep the option “Require my password to log in” enabled.

9. Ready to install

By clicking Next, you'll be taken to a summary of your installation settings, giving you an opportunity to review your configuration before proceeding with the Install button.
